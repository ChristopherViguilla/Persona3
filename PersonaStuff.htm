    <title>Persona 3 Review</title>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> My Evaluation of Persona 3 </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Persona 3 is a JRPG produced by Atlus. The title, "Persona 3" encompasses three games, Persona 3, Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable. There is actually no definitive version that encompasses all game mechanics properly. Persona 3 is bare bones but still in 3D thanks to the hardware. Persona 3 FES builds on the established game by heightening the graphical fidelity and adds a second story piece. And Persona 3 Portable adds the ability to control you party in battle, an omitted mechanic in the pervious games, and adds the ability to play as a female protaganist, though the extra story piece in FES is omitted. Join me on a small opinion pice on my personal experience with Persona 3</p>

    <h1>Persona 3's Gameplay</h1>

    <p> Persona 3 (For the purposes of this evaluation, I will use Persona 3 Portable as it's the rendition I've played) in my opinion is the strongest and weakest simultaneously in terms of gameplay. On one hand, the gameplay gives character to the other party members by having them be unavailable on certain days for exploring Tartarus (The big dungeon of Persona 3). Along with the status and wellbeing of party members, they feel like real people with their own lives outside of the plot and the player character's life. Though, it can be incredibly annoying if after planning on going to level up, a party member you use often decides not to show up or is sick. Along with the social link system that is in every Persona game (This game making it more complex with the chance to negatively affect relationships), it's one of the most in depth gameplay wise and can make newcomers or people who've only played the latest game suffer.</p>
